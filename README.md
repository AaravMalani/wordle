# Wordle : my implementation of the wordle game
> This project is a simple implementation of the wordle game to showcase my skills in the React library.

## What is wordle?
Wordle is a game where you have to guess a word in 5 tries. The word is randomly generated and you have to guess it by typing it in the input field. The game will tell you if the letter you typed is in the word and if it is in the right place. If you guess the word, you win, otherwise you lose.
you will understand more by running the project and playing the game.

## How to run the project?
1. Clone the project
   ```Bash
    git clone https://github.com/reda-benmakdad/wordle.git
    ```
3. Install the dependencies
    ```Bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the project
    ```Bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Enjoy the game by visiting [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser


## Technologies used
- React
- Axios
- Free Dictionary API
- Node.js
- Pure css


## Left to do:
> the interface is implemented and basic game logic is working, but there are still some features to add:

- find a way to generate a random word to guess, since now i try guessing the harcoded word "water" each time.
- stop game when user guesses right, or after 5 tries.
