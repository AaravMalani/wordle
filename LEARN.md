## Making process of the project

I played a lot of wordle on https://wordlegame.org/ and i was thinking if i was capable of implementing this game myself, soo...i gave it a try and here we are.

first of all i designed this "fun game" looking website on figma, as i wanted to learn figma, it was pretty hard as a newbie to figma but i eventually got a result that you can check [here!](https://www.figma.com/file/lH963810KtCFM2r9hBFjcB/Wordle?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=SGXbsLIWPJtbIOHR-1)

I then implemted this design in react, i created various components for the different parts of the game, that i styled accordingly to the figma design in pure css. i used axios to fetch the word definition from the free dictionary api.

I then coded the game logic word typing, checking if word exists, tries...etc. using react state and props and basic javascript.
